2. **Non-premium users** ‚Üí Shows "Go Premium" button  
3. **Monthly premium users viewing yearly features** ‚Üí Shows "Upgrade to Yearly" + "Check Plans" buttons

## Component Props

```jsx
<FeatureLock
    featureName="Feature Name"           // Name displayed in the lock overlay
    description="Custom description"     // Optional: Custom lock message
    requireYearly={true}                 // Set to true for yearly-only features
>
    {/* Your feature content here */}
</FeatureLock>
```

- ‚úÖ AI Code Assistant (ChatAi component)
- ‚úÖ 500+ Premium Problems
- ‚úÖ Video Solutions
- ‚úÖ Advanced Analytics

## User Experience Flow

### For Monthly Users Clicking Yearly Features:
1. **Content is blurred** - Users see a preview but can't interact
2. **Clear message displayed** - Explains why it's locked and what plan is required
3. **Two action buttons shown:**
   - **"Upgrade to Yearly Plan"** (Primary CTA) - Direct upgrade
   - **"Check Plans"** (Secondary) - View all plan options
4. **Current plan info shown** - Reminds them they have monthly premium
5. **Benefits preview** - Lists what they'll unlock with yearly upgrade

### For Non-Premium Users:
1. Content is blurred
2. "Go Premium" button shown
3. Redirects to `/premium` page

### For Yearly Users:
1. Content unlocked - No overlay shown
2. Full access to all features

## Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Wrap entire feature sections with FeatureLock
- ‚úÖ Use descriptive feature names
- ‚úÖ Provide clear upgrade benefits
- ‚úÖ Always set `requireYearly={true}` for yearly-only features
- ‚úÖ Show "Check Plans" button for existing premium users

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Lock features available in monthly plan

- ‚ùå Hide "Check Plans" option from premium users
- ‚ùå Block navigation to premium page
